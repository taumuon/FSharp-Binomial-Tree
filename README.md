FSharp-Binomial-Tree
====================

Simple example of an F# Binomial Tree implementation, demonstrating refactoring imperative code to a functional style.

See blog at taumuon-jabuka.blogspot.com for an explanation.

Switch between the refactorings by changing the 
open AmericanPut
declaration in Program.fs to change which module is loaded.
